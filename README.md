## Kaggle Chalenge where i achive really precise Convolutional Neural Network that classify iceberg from sheps 
In this task the key was data augmentatioan and transfer learning because we had just a little examples for train more conretly 
1600 examples wich is not enough for train the aproximatley 500.000 paramters that the network should learn.
Conclusion of the training process was a 0.1950  score of validation_loss wich means a 1500 position in the chalenge really 
good result for just a few hours dedicted to this chalenge .
